The dataset was created and reviewed using a combination of publicly available datasets and real-world recordings, covering a wide range of vehicle faults, crashes, emergency sirens (police, ambulance, fire truck),

wild animal sounds, car and truck horns, and other environmental road sounds. This approach ensures a diverse and realistic dataset that enhances model performance in detecting road-related events.

1. Data Collection and Annotation
   
•	We carefully selected publicly available datasets that include real traffic scenarios and vehicle fault cases.

•	Additionally, we extracted relevant frames and sequences from YouTube videos, ensuring a diverse representation of traffic conditions and vehicle behaviors.

•	Each data sample was manually labeled based on predefined criteria, focusing on vehicle states, traffic interactions, and specific fault conditions.
________________________________________
2. Expert Review and Validation
   
•	To enhance reliability, domain experts with extensive experience in automotive engineering and machine learning reviewed the dataset.

•	The experts cross-checked and validated the labels to ensure accuracy and consistency with real-world vehicle behaviors.

3. Publicly Available Datasets Referenced
   
We utilized multiple datasets containing wild animal sounds, vehicle faults, and environmental noises to build a comprehensive dataset. The key datasets referenced include:

•	[FSC22 Dataset]: A collection focused on various sound categories, including vehicle sounds and environmental noises, useful for sound classification models [1].

•	[Google AudioSet]: A large-scale collection of audio data across thousands of categories, aimed at improving sound classification models [2].

•	[Audio Data]: A dataset containing diverse audio clips across various categories, useful for developing classification models [3].

•	[Sound Classification of Animal Voice]: A dataset containing sounds from different animals, useful for animal sound classification tasks [4].

•	[DCASE 2024 Challenge]: A dataset designed for the DCASE 2024 challenge, covering environmental sound classification tasks [5].

•	[UrbanSound8K Dataset]: Contains 8,732 labeled sound excerpts from urban environments, categorized into 10 classes such as car horns and sirens [6].

•	[AudioSet by Google Research]: A vast dataset with over 2 million human-labeled 10-second sound clips spanning thousands of audio categories [7].

•	[Vehicle Sounds Dataset]: Contains various vehicle sounds useful for training models focused on transportation-related sound classification [8].
