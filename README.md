The dataset was created and reviewed using a combination of publicly available datasets and real-world recordings, 

covering a wide range of vehicle faults, crashes, emergency sirens (police, ambulance, fire truck), wild animal sounds, car and truck horns, and other environmental road sounds.

This approach ensures a diverse and realistic dataset that enhances model performance in detecting road-related events.

1. Publicly Available Datasets Referenced [1]-[9]
   
We utilized several datasets containing wild animal sounds, vehicle faults, and environmental noises to build a comprehensive dataset.

The key datasets referenced include:

Vehicle Faults and Road Sounds: The "FSC22 Dataset" [1], "Google AudioSet" [2], and "Vehicle Sounds Dataset" [8] were instrumental in covering various vehicle faults and road-related noises,

while the "DCASE 2024 Challenge" [5] provided additional vehicle and environmental sound recordings. "Audio Data" [3] also contributed to the broader range of environmental and road sounds included in the dataset.

Wild Animal Sounds and Environmental Sounds: Datasets like the "Sound Classification of Animal Voice" [4] and "UrbanSound8K Dataset" [6] provided a diverse set of animal and environmental sounds.


3. Vehicle Faults Categorized in the Dataset
   
The dataset includes multiple vehicle faults, ensuring coverage of mechanical, transmission, braking, and steering issues. The specific fault categories are:

✅ Transmission and Drivetrain Faults

•	Bad CV Joint

•	Bad Transmission

•	Bad Wheel Bearing

•	Universal Joint Failure / Steering Rack Failure

•	Turning Front-End Clicking (Bad CV Axle)

✅ Engine and Exhaust Faults

•	Engine Chirping / Squealing Belt

•	Engine Misfire

•	Engine Rattle Noise

•	Flooded Engine

•	Fuel Pump Cartridge Fault

•	Knocking

•	Lifter Ticking

•	Loose Exhaust Shield

•	Muffler Running Loud (Exhaust Leak)

•	Pre-Ignition

•	Seized Engine

•	Thrown Rod

•	Vacuum Leak

✅ Suspension and Steering Faults

•	Clunking Over Bumps (Bad Stabilizer Link Noise)

•	Steering Groaning / Whining (Low Power Steering Fluid)

•	Steering Noise

•	Strut Mount Failure

•	Suspension Arm Fault

✅ Cooling System and Fan Faults

•	Radiator Fan Failure

✅ Braking System Faults

•	Squeaky Belt

•	Squeaky Brake / Grinding Brake

5. Car Crash References
   
To include realistic car crash scenarios in our dataset, we utilized real-world accident recordings from YouTube [10]–[38].

7. Animal Sound References
   
To ensure the dataset accurately reflects real-world environmental conditions, we included animal sounds from various real-world recordings available on YouTube [39]–[51].

9. Additional Car Fault References
    
We supplemented our dataset with real-world recordings of car faults obtained from Instagram and YouTube [52]–[73].
